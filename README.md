- 🌱 **Current Focus:** Learning the fundamentals of **LLM Fine-Tuning** (Llama 3) and model optimization.
- 💻 **Hardware Journey:** I recently migrated my AI workflow from **AMD to Nvidia** to better support for my learning.
- 🛠️ **Custom Tools:** I built my own **PHP Knowledge Base** to document terminal commands and solve the driver issues I encountered along the way.
- 🤝 **Collaboration:** **I am open to any type of project!** Whether it's Web Dev, Python scripts, or AI—I am eager to learn, contribute, and build my skills.

### 📂 Featured Projects
* [Llama-3-Fine-Tuning](https://github.com/Denis112500/YOUR-REPO-NAME) — Documenting my AI learning and error fixes.
* [Personal Knowledge Base](https://github.com/Denis112500/YOUR-KB-REPO) — A PHP tool I built to track technical solutions.

### 📝 My Approach & Mentorship
* **Mentorship:** I want to give a huge thanks to ****, who helped me tremendously when I first started coding. His guidance was key to getting me into this world.
* **AI Assistance:** I use AI as a digital tutor to help explain complex theories and draft boilerplate code. This allows me to focus on understanding the core logic and solving the real-world environment challenges that AI can't fix for me.
