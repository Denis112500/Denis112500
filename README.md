### 🔭 What I'm Up To
- 🎓 **University:** Focusing on core programming logic with **C++** and **Java**. I also build desktop applications using **C# (Windows Forms)**.
- 🌱 **Self-Learning:** Diving deep into **Python** and **LLM Fine-Tuning** (Llama 3) using Unsloth.
- 💻 **Hardware:** I recently migrated my AI workflow from **AMD (ROCm) to Nvidia (CUDA)** to better support for my learning.
- 🛠️ **Custom Tools:** I built my own **PHP Knowledge Base** to document terminal commands and solve the driver issues I encountered along the way.
- 🤝 **Collaboration:** **I am open to any type of project!** Whether it's Web Dev, Python scripts, or AI, I am eager to learn, contribute, and build my skills.
 
- 👨🏾‍🦯‍➡️ Note: Still very much learning,expect messy commits 🙂

### 📂 Featured Projects
* [Llama-3-Fine-Tuning](https://github.com/Denis112500/AI-Lab) - Documenting my AI learning and error fixes.
* [java-mini-game](https://github.com/Denis112500/java-mini-game) - Java mini game project.
* Personal Knowledge Base - A PHP tool I built to track technical solutions.
* C# Windows Forms App - A practical look at GUI development from my university coursework.

### 📝 My Approach & Mentorship
* **Mentorship:** I want to give a huge thanks to **Flavius**, who helped me really much when I first started coding. His guidance was key to getting me into this world of programming.
* **AI Assistance:** I use AI as a digital tutor to help explain complex theories and draft boilerplate code. This allows me to focus on understanding the core logic and solving the real-world environment challenges that AI can't fix for me.
